    Thor In Germanic mythology, Thor from Old Norse is a hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, 
    thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the protection of mankind and also hallowing and 
    fertility. Besides Old Norse, the deity occurs in Old English as Ãžunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, 
    in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar.
